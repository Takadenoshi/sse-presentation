# Server-Sent Events (SSE)

## A server-push protocol

- Unidirectional: Server -> Client
- Essentially a streaming HTTP/1.1 GET (or HTTP/2)
  - Connection is kept open, server writes more data as it becomes available
- (Web) Client side interacts with SSE endpoints using `EventSource`
  - Register `data` or custom `event` callbacks
  - A MessageEvent Interface
- With reconnection batteries included*
  - Terms and conditions may apply

---

# Use cases

Replaces polling. Stream any kind of update from the server.

- notifications
- live ticker data
- live sports events
- anything that is UTF-8 suitable

---

# What is this ~~new~~ thing?

# Minimum Viable SSE response


The simplest server-sent event stream specifies just `data` events.

Example with 2 events:

```
> GET /stream/hello HTTP/1.1

< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: text/event-stream

< data: Hello\n\n

< data: ReactLive are you there?\n\n
```

Content-Type is `text/event-stream`

Events separated by two newline characters `\n\n`

Data is encoded in UTF-8 (mandatory)

<sup>[Playground](https://github.com/takadenoshi/sse-presentation): "simple" scenario</sup>

---

# Simple EventSource consumer

Server-sent events are consumed with `EventSource`:

```
let i=0;

const source = new EventSource("http://localhost:3001/stream/simple");

// "message" event emitted for each "data" event received
source.addEventListener("message", (event) => console.log(++i, event.data), false);

```

The "minimum viable response" from the previous slide would trigger the callback twice, logging:


:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

```



1 Hello

2 ReactLive are you there?
```

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

```
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: text/event-stream

< data: Hello\n\n

< data: ReactLive are you there?\n\n
```

:::
::::::::::::::

---

# Named Events

You can "namespace" your events using the `event` field with any custom name:

```
< event: goal
< data: "ARS-LIV 1-1 45"\n\n

< event: spectator-chat
< data: "Did you see that ludicrous display just now"\n\n
```

The `goal` and `spectator-chat` events are handled separately on the frontend

- Allows multiplexing / routing events 
  - no need for pattern matching on a shared data payload

---

# Comments

Any lines starting with `:` (colon) are interpreted as comments 

```
< data: this or that\n\n

< :TODO emit some events in the near future
```

These are ignored on the client-side

---

# Reconnection (1)

By default*, EventSource consumers will reconnect if the connection is interrupted.

<sup>\* _with implementation-specific caveats_</sup>

The default reconnection timeout is up to each browser (empirically: between 3-5 s.)

## Custom timeouts

The reconnection timeout can be customized from the server-side by emitting a `retry:` field in any of the events.

```
retry: 2500
data: Hello!\n\n

```

Value is in ms; timeouts are linear.

<sup>[Playground](https://github.com/takadenoshi/sse-presentation): "Retry-flaky" scenario</sup>

---

# Reconnection (2)

## Computer can say no

A server can signal "do not reconnect":

- with a `Content-Type` header other than `text/event-stream`
- with a `2xx` response other than 200
  - 301, 307 redirects to a 200 are OK

<sup>[Playground](https://github.com/takadenoshi/sse-presentation): "Not SSE" scenario</sup>

---

# Reconnection (3) - Last-Event-ID

Events can include an `id` field with any UTF-8 string as value.

Connection interrupted? Reconnection header `Last-Event-ID` set to the last id received.

This allows the server to resume gracefully.

<hr />

If this is the last event received in a stream that disconnects:
```
< id: data-0
< retry: 5000
< data: Data Zero event\n
```

Then the connection timeout will be 5 seconds, and the `Last-Event-ID` header will be set to `data-0`.

```
> GET /stream/notifications HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:3001
> Last-Event-ID: data-0
```

<sup>[Playground](https://github.com/takadenoshi/sse-presentation): "notifications" scenario</sup>

# The EventSource Interface

- `constructor(url, { withCredentials: boolean })`
  - `withCredentials`: instantiate with CORS credentials (default: false)

- Events:
  - `open`: on connection
  - `error`: on error/disconnection
  - `message`: on generic data: event received
  - `<custom>:` on named event received

- `addEventListener(event_name: string, (event: Event) => void, bubbles: boolean)`
- readyState: `CONNECTING` (0) | `OPEN` (1) | `CLOSED`(2)
  - CONNECTING: also "waiting to reconnect"
  - CLOSED: will not attempt to reconnect

- close()

---

# EventSource: custom events

You can subscribe to custom events (e.g. `status`) with `.addEventListener`:

```
const source = new EventSource('/stream/hello');

// [name]: triggers for custom named event, here: "status"
source.addEventListener(
  "status",
  ({ data }) => console.log("custom event: status", JSON.parse(data)),
  false,
);

// as before, un-named data events
source.addEventListener(
  "message", 
  (event) => { console.log("data event", event.data); },
  false,
);
```

---

# EventSource: connection events

Subscribe to `open` and `error` for connection management:

```
// on connection established
source.addEventListener(
  "open",
  (event) => { console.log("Connection status"); },
  false
);

// on disconnection
source.addEventListener(
  "error",
  (event) => { console.log("Connection status"); },
  false
);
```


# Error event is a bit useless

- Single bit of information: "error"

- callback signature is `(event: Event) => void`
  - event.target instanceof EventSource

- No reason or message can be derived 
  - usually output in console

- Some disconnections can be "fatal", cancelling the reconnection policy.

- Inspect `readyState` to find out EventSource's intent:
  - CONNECTING: will reconnect / waiting to reconnect / reconnecting
  - CLOSED: will not reconnect

# Implementation Considerations: HTTP/1.1 connections quota

Browsers implement a **per-hostname connection quota** (6) for HTTP/1.1

SSE over HTTP/1.1 may hit this easily with multiple tabs open

Per [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#listening_for_custom_events):

> Warning: When not used over HTTP/2, SSE suffers from a **limitation to the maximum number of open connections**, which can be especially painful when opening multiple tabs, as the limit is per browser and is set to a very low number (6). The issue has been marked as "Won't fix" in [Chrome](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=275955) and [Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=906896). This limit is per browser + domain, which means that you can open 6 SSE connections across all of the tabs to www.example1.com and another 6 SSE connections to www.example2.com (per Stackoverflow).

> When using HTTP/2, the maximum number of simultaneous HTTP streams is negotiated between the server and the client (defaults to 100).

## Solutions

- **Prefer HTTP/2 where available** (can-i-use 96% yes)
- If applicable, use an EventSource within a SharedWorker
  - shared by all tabs
- Use subdomains for SSE endpoint(s)

# Implementation Considerations: Reconnecting

**Default reconnection behavior implementation is not fully standardized**

When a network error is encountered:

- Firefox: Will **stop** retrying (standard compliant)
- Chrome: Will **keep** retrying (actually helpful)

**Consider handling reconnections yourself:**

- Option for exponential backoff strategies
- Better connection timeout detection

<hr />

Test it out in the [playground repo](https://github.com/takadenoshi/sse-presentation):

- Start react-app but not the server
- Open react-app on Firefox
- Connect to any endpoint
- Firefox will attempt to reconnect once, encounter a network error, then stop
  - Chrome will instead keep reconnecting

---

# Implementation Considerations: Proxies (1)

## Proxies can kill

Proxies, load balancers and other networking middleware can kill idle connections after a short while.

<hr />

Two approaches to fix this:

## 1/ Comment (not client-aware)

You can emit a comment (any line starting with a colon `:`)

```
< :bump
```

Good enough to keep connection alive.

EventSource won't emit any event.

---

# Implementation Considerations: Proxies (2)

## Proxies can kill

Proxies, load balancers and other networking middleware can kill idle connections after a short while.

<hr />

Two approaches to fix this:

## 2/ Heartbeat event (client-aware)

Emit a custom "heartbeat" or "ping" event every 15 seconds or so:

```
< event: heartbeat
< data: ""
```

(data field **must** be present)

The client can listen to this event and use it to detect stale connections:

**"expect heartbeats every N seconds, otherwise reconnect"**

Preferred approach, especially for important payloads.

---

# Implementation Considerations: Service Workers (Firefox)

## Firefox Service Workers ðŸ’” EventSource

Firefox has yet to implement support for EventSource in its Service Worker context.

Future people can track the present validity of this statement [here](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1681218).

âœ… But you can use it in a SharedWorker

---

# Implementation Considerations: Last-Event-ID detail

**If no event is emitted in the subsequent connection's lifetime, the Last-Event-ID is reset.**

<hr />

When a reconnected session is initialized with `Last-Event-ID: Some-id`

And the connection emits no messages for its lifetime,

Then the Last-Event-ID value is _reset_.

# Vs competiting options

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}

## 1a/ Polling

Keep requesting new data on an interval

- Slower
- Usually more resource intensive than SSE

Benefit: Doesn't "hog" a connection (HTTP/1.1)

## 1b/ Long Polling

"Hanging GET" - server keeps connection open/hanging until there is something to write.

Client loops the GET request.

:::
::: {.column width="32%"}

## 2/ SSE

- Like formalized, reusable long polling
- HTTP + REST compatible
  - Works with your existing framework
  - Works with your existing auth
- Reconnecting

:::
::: {.column width="32%"}

## 3/ Websockets

- Not HTTP/REST
  - Websocket server usually a separate beast
- Must bring your own:
  - Routing
  - Auth
  - Error handling
  - TLS Certs (duplicated)
- Pain to debug
- Bidirectional/full duplex
  - good if you need it
