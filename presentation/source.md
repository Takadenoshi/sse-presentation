# Minimum Viable SSE response


The simplest server-sent event stream specifies just `data` events.

```
> GET /stream/hello HTTP/1.1

< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: text/event-stream

< data: Hello\n\n

< data: ReactLive are you there?\n\n
```

Events separated by two newline characters `\n\n`

Data is encoded in UTF-8 (mandatory)

<sup>[Playground](https://github.com/takadenoshi/sse-presentation): "simple" scenario</sup>

---

# Simple EventSource consumer

Server-sent events are consumed with `EventSource`:

```{.javascript .numberLines}
let i=0;

const source = new EventSource("http://localhost:3001/stream/simple");

// "message" event emitted for each "data" event received
source.addEventListener("message", event => console.log(++i, event.data), false);
// or .onmessage = (...) if that is your jam

```

Previous slide's data would result in:

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

```
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: text/event-stream

< data: Hello\n\n

< data: ReactLive are you there?\n\n
```

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

```



1 Hello

2 ReactLive are you there?
```

# Named Events

You can "namespace" your events using the `event` field with any custom name:

```
< event: goal
< data: "ARS-LIV 1-1 45"\n\n

< event: spectator-chat
< data: "Did you see that ludicrous display just now"\n\n
```

The `goal` and `spectator-chat` events are handled separately on the frontend

- Allows multiplexing / routing events 
  - no need for pattern matching on a shared data payload

---

# Named Events: Live Demo

In the live reactions demo, we stream two types of things:

- number of clients (as `clients` event)
- emoji enum value (as unnamed message)

```
< event: clients
< data: 10

< data: [1,2,3,4]
```

Each event is on a separate listener and triggering the appropriate action

---

# Comments

Any lines starting with `:` (colon) are interpreted as comments 

```
< data: this or that\n\n

< :TODO emit some events in the near future
```

These are ignored on the client-side

---

# Reconnection (1)

EventSource consumers will reconnect* if the connection is interrupted.

Default reconnection timeout ~ 3-5 s.

<sup>\* _with implementation-specific caveats_</sup>

## Custom timeouts

The reconnection timeout can be customized.

Emit a `retry:` field in any of the events:

```
< retry: 2500
< data: Hello!\n\n
```

- Value is in milliseconds
- Timeouts are linear

<sup>[Playground](https://github.com/takadenoshi/sse-presentation): "Retry-flaky" scenario</sup>

---

# Reconnection (2)

## Computer can say no

A server can signal "do not reconnect":

- with a `Content-Type` header other than `text/event-stream`
- with a `2xx` response other than 200
  - 301, 307 redirects to a 200 are OK
- TODO 4xx / 5xx ?

<sup>[Playground](https://github.com/takadenoshi/sse-presentation): "Not SSE" scenario</sup>

---

# Reconnection (3) - Last-Event-ID

Events can include an `id` field (value: any UTF-8 string)

Connection interrupted? Reconnection header `Last-Event-ID` set to the last id received.

This allows the server to resume gracefully.

<hr />

If this is the last event received in a stream that disconnects:
```
< id: data-0
< retry: 5000
< data: Data Zero event\n
```

Then the connection timeout will be 5 seconds, and the `Last-Event-ID` header will be set to `data-0`.

```
> GET /stream/notifications HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:3001
> Last-Event-ID: data-0
```

<sup>[Playground](https://github.com/takadenoshi/sse-presentation): "notifications" scenario</sup>

# EventSource: custom events

You can subscribe to custom events (e.g. `status`) with `.addEventListener`:

```{.javascript .numberLines}
const source = new EventSource('/stream/hello');

// [name]: triggers for custom named event, here: "status"
source.addEventListener(
  "status",
  ({ data }) => console.log("custom event: status", JSON.parse(data)),
  false,
);

// as before, un-named data events
source.addEventListener(
  "message", 
  (event) => { console.log("data event", event.data); },
  false,
);
```

---

# EventSource: connection events

Subscribe to `open` and `error` for connection management:

```{.javascript .numberLines}
// on connection established
source.addEventListener(
  "open",
  (event) => { console.log("Connection status"); },
  false
);

// on disconnection
source.addEventListener(
  "error",
  (event) => { console.log("Connection status"); },
  false
);
```

---

# The EventSource Interface

- `constructor(url, { withCredentials: boolean })`
  - `withCredentials`: instantiate with CORS credentials (default: false)
- Events:
  - `open`: on connection
  - `error`: on error/disconnection
  - `message`: on generic data: event received
  - `<custom>:` on named event received
- `addEventListener(event_name: string, (event: Event) => void, bubbles: boolean)`
- readyState: `CONNECTING` (0) | `OPEN` (1) | `CLOSED`(2)
  - CONNECTING: also "waiting to reconnect"
  - CLOSED: will not attempt to reconnect
- close()

---

# Error event is a bit useless

- Single bit of information: "error"

- callback signature is `(event: Event) => void`
  - event.target instanceof EventSource

- No reason or message can be derived 
  - usually output in console

- Some disconnections can be "fatal", cancelling the reconnection policy.

- Inspect `readyState` to find out EventSource's intent:
  - CONNECTING: will reconnect / waiting to reconnect / reconnecting
  - CLOSED: will not reconnect

---

# Implementation Considerations: No custom headers

It is not possible to set custom HTTP headers on SSE requests using `EventSource`

---


# Implementation Considerations: HTTP/1.1

## HTTP/1.1 connections quota

**Per-hostname connection quota** over HTTP/1.1

Max number of connections: 6

Browser-wide enforcement (shared by all tabs)

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#listening_for_custom_events) [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5195452/websockets-vs-server-sent-events-eventsource/5326159)

Too much SSE without planning -> choking your performance

# Implementation Considerations: HTTP/1.1

## Possible Solutions

- **Prefer HTTP/2 where available** (can-i-use 96% yes)
  - [When using HTTP/2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#listening_for_custom_events), the maximum number of simultaneous HTTP streams is negotiated between the server and the client (defaults to 100)
- Use an EventSource within a SharedWorker
  - Applicable to global streams
  - Used by all tabs
- Use subdomains for SSE endpoint(s)
  - Each subdomain -> another 6 connection threads
  - Global HTTP/1.1 browser limits also apply
      - Don't overdo it

# Implementation Considerations: Reconnecting

**Default reconnection behavior implementation issue:**

When a network error is encountered:

- Firefox: Will **stop** retrying (standard compliant)
- Chrome: Will **keep** retrying (actually helpful)

<hr />

Test it out in the [playground repo](https://github.com/takadenoshi/sse-presentation):

- Start react-app but not the server
- Open react-app in Chrome and Firefox
- Try to connect to any endpoint
- Chrome will keep trying to reconnect vs Firefox will quit after one network error

---

# Implementation Considerations: Reconnecting

**Recommendation: consider handling reconnections explicitly**

- Ensure uniform behavior everywhere
- Option for exponential backoff strategies
- Better connection timeout detection
- Rotate multiple backend endpoints

---

# Implementation Considerations: Proxies (1)

## Proxies can kill

Proxies, load balancers and other networking middleware can kill idle connections after a short while.

Two approaches to fix this:

<hr />

## 1/ Comment (not client-aware)

You can emit a comment (any line starting with a colon `:`)

```
< :bump
```

Good enough to keep connection alive.

EventSource won't emit any event.

---

# Implementation Considerations: Proxies (2)

## Proxies can kill

Proxies, load balancers and other networking middleware can kill idle connections after a short while.

Two approaches to fix this:

<hr />

## 2/ Heartbeat event (client-aware)

Emit a custom "heartbeat" or "ping" event every 15 seconds or so:

```
< event: heartbeat
< data: ""
```

(data field **must** be present)

The client can listen to this event and use it to detect stale connections:

**"expect heartbeats every N seconds, otherwise reconnect"**

Preferred approach, especially for important payloads.

---

# Implementation Considerations: Service Workers (Firefox)

## Firefox Service Workers üíî EventSource

Firefox has yet to implement support for EventSource in its Service Worker context.

Future people can track the present validity of this statement [here](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1681218).

‚úÖ But you can use it in a SharedWorker

---

# Implementation Considerations: Last-Event-ID detail

**If no event is emitted in the subsequent connection's lifetime, the Last-Event-ID is reset.**

<hr />

When a reconnected session is initialized with `Last-Event-ID: Some-id`

And the connection emits no messages for its lifetime,

Then the Last-Event-ID value is _reset_.

# Vs Polling

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

![](assets/images/Polling.png)

:::
::: {.column width="33%"}

SSE Pro:

- More immediate results
  - no waiting
- Fewer round trips
- Less DB load

SSE Con:

- Keeps a connection open
  - Can be an issue

# Vs competiting options

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}

## 1a/ Polling

Keep requesting new data on an interval

- Slower
- Usually more resource intensive than SSE

Benefit: Doesn't "hog" a connection (HTTP/1.1)

## 1b/ Long Polling

"Hanging GET" - server keeps connection open/hanging until there is something to write.

Client loops the GET request.

:::
::: {.column width="32%"}

## 2/ SSE

- Like formalized, reusable long polling
- HTTP + REST compatible
  - Works with your existing framework
  - Works with your existing auth
- Reconnecting

:::
::: {.column width="32%"}

## 3/ Websockets

- Not HTTP/REST
  - Websocket server usually a separate beast
- Must bring your own:
  - Routing
  - Auth
  - Error handling
  - TLS Certs (duplicated)
- Pain to debug
- Bidirectional/full duplex
  - good if you need it

# Kadena use case

Blockchain stuff usually comes with lots of polling.

Kadena's Chainweb is 20 "braided" chains -> 20x polling threads (worst case)

[Chainweb-stream](https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-stream):

- SSE Server
- Streams transactions of a certain type (specific account or application/contract)

[Chainweb-stream-client](https://github.com/kadena-community/kadena.js/tree/main/packages/libs/chainweb-stream-client):

- Client side lib (node, browser)
- Detects stale connections (heartbeat events)
- Detects initial connection timeouts
- Custom reconnection (exponential backoffs)
