# Server-Sent Events (SSE)

![](assets/images/diagram-SSE.png){.float-right}

- Essentially a streaming GET
  - Server writes more data as it becomes available

. . .

- Unidirectional
  - Server -> Client

. . .

- UTF-8 only

. . .

- Reconnection batteries included
  - Terms and conditions may apply

---

# Like polling but better

Best suited for UTF-8 updates

. . .

Especially for multiple update channels

---

# Polling vs SSE

![](assets/images/diagram-SSE.png){.float-right}

![](assets/images/diagram-polling.png)

---

# Like WebSockets but -

- Unidirectional & UTF-8

. . .

- Easy to debug
  - just `curl` it ‚úÖ

. . .

- Is HTTP/REST -> easier integrated
  - Happy part of your RESTful server backend
    - vs WS the trying-to-fit-in cousin

. . .

- Easier for third parties & exotic networks (?)

. . .

- WS seems overkill for unidirectional
  - But if it works for you üëç

# Minimum Viable SSE response


The simplest server-sent event stream specifies just `data` events.

```
> GET /stream/hello HTTP/1.1

< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: text/event-stream

< data: Hello\n\n

< data: ReactLive are you there?\n\n
```

. . .

Events separated by two newline characters `\n\n`

Data is encoded in UTF-8 (mandatory)

<sup>[Playground](https://github.com/takadenoshi/sse-presentation): "simple" scenario</sup>

---

# Simple EventSource consumer

Server-sent events are consumed with `EventSource`:

```{.javascript .numberLines}
let i=0;

const source = new EventSource("http://localhost:3001/stream/simple");

// "message" event emitted for each "data" event received
source.addEventListener("message", event => console.log(++i, event.data), false);

// or .onmessage = (...) if that is your jam

```

# Named Events

You can "namespace" your events using the `event` field with any custom name:

```
< event: goal
< data: "ARS-LIV 1-1 45"\n\n

< event: spectator-chat
< data: "Did you see that ludicrous display just now"\n\n
```

. . .

The `goal` and `spectator-chat` events are handled separately on the frontend

- Allows multiplexing / routing events 
  - no need for pattern matching on a shared data payload

---

# Events: Live Demo

In the live reactions demo, we stream two types of things:

- `clients` event: number of clients
- `data` event: list of emoji enum values (1-8)

```
< event: clients
< data: 10

< data: [1,2,3,4]
```

---

# Reconnection (1)

EventSource consumers will reconnect* if the connection is interrupted.

Default reconnection timeout ~ 3-5 s.

<sup>\* _with implementation-specific caveats_</sup>

---

# Reconnection (2) - Custom timeouts

The reconnection timeout can be customized.

Emit a `retry:` field in any of the events:

```
< retry: 2500
< data: Hello!\n\n
```

- Value is in milliseconds
- Timeouts are linear

<sup>[Playground](https://github.com/takadenoshi/sse-presentation): "Retry-flaky" scenario</sup>

---

# Reconnection (3) - Last-Event-ID

Events can include an `id` field with any UTF-8 string as value

. . .

Connection interrupted? Sets reconnection header `Last-Event-ID: x`

```
< id: data-0
< retry: 5000
< data: Data Zero event\n
```

üíî **Disconnects**

‚û°Ô∏è  _5 seconds later_

```
> GET /stream/notifications HTTP/1.1
> Last-Event-ID: data-0
```

# EventSource: custom events

You can subscribe to custom events with `.addEventListener`:

```{.javascript .numberLines}
const source = new EventSource('/stream/hello');

// [name]: triggers for custom named event, here: "status"
source.addEventListener(
  "status",
  ({ data }) => console.log("custom event: status", JSON.parse(data)),
  false,
);

// as before, unnamed data events
source.addEventListener(
  "message", 
  (event) => { console.log("data event", event.data); },
  false,
);
```

---

# EventSource: connection events

Subscribe to `open` and `error` for connection management:

```{.javascript .numberLines}
// on connection established
source.addEventListener(
  "open",
  (event) => { console.log("Connection opened"); },
  false
);

// on disconnection
source.addEventListener(
  "error",
  (event) => { console.log("Connection error"); },
  false
);
```

---

# The EventSource Interface

- `constructor(url, { withCredentials: boolean })`
  - `withCredentials`: instantiate with CORS credentials (default: false)
- Events: `open` | `error` | `message` | `<custom-name>`
  - addEventListener, onmessage, onerror, ...
- `close()`
- `readyState`: State <u>intent</u> enum: `CONNECTING` (0) | `OPEN` (1) | `CLOSED`(2)
  - CONNECTING: also "waiting to reconnect"
  - CLOSED: will not attempt to reconnect

# Error event is a bit useless

- Single bit of information: "error"

- callback signature is `(event: Event) => void`
  - `event.target` is instanceof `EventSource`
  - no reason / message / code

- Some disconnections can be "fatal", cancelling the reconnection policy

- Inspect `readyState` to find out EventSource's intent:
  - CONNECTING: will reconnect / waiting to reconnect / reconnecting
  - CLOSED: will not reconnect

# Implementation Considerations: HTTP/1.1

## HTTP/1.1 connections quota

Max number of connections: 6

. . .

Per-hostname quota

Browser-wide enforcement (shared by all tabs)

Too much SSE without planning -> choke

::: notes
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#listening_for_custom_events) [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5195452/websockets-vs-server-sent-events-eventsource/5326159)
:::

# Implementation Considerations: HTTP/1.1

## Possible Solutions


- **Prefer HTTP/2 where available** (can-i-use 96% yes)
  - max number of [simultaneous HTTP streams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#listening_for_custom_events) is negotiated (defaults to 100)
  
. . .

- Use an EventSource within a SharedWorker
  - Used by all tabs
  - Applicable for global streams
  
. . .

- Use subdomains for SSE endpoint(s)
  - Each subdomain -> another 6 connection threads
  - Global HTTP/1.1 browser limits apply (~20)
      - Don't overdo it 

---

# Implementation Considerations: Reconnecting

## Different Browser Implementations

When a network error is encountered:

- Firefox: Will **stop** retrying (standard compliant)
- Chrome: Will **keep** retrying (actually helpful)

<hr />

. . .

Test it out in the [playground repo](https://github.com/takadenoshi/sse-presentation):

- Start react-app but not the server
- Open react-app in Chrome and Firefox
- Try to connect to any endpoint
- Observe behavior of each browser

---

# Implementation Considerations: Computer says no

A server can signal "do not reconnect":

- with a `Content-Type` header other than `text/event-stream`
- with a `2xx` response other than 200
  - 301, 307 redirects to a 200 are OK
- TODO 4xx / 5xx ?

<sup>[Playground](https://github.com/takadenoshi/sse-presentation): "Not SSE" scenario</sup>

---

# Implementation Considerations: Reconnecting

**Recommendation: consider handling reconnections explicitly**

- Ensure uniform behavior
- Option for exponential backoff strategies
- Better connection timeout detection
- Rotate multiple backend endpoints

---

# Implementation Considerations: Proxies (1)

## Proxies can kill

Proxies, load balancers and other networking middleware can kill idle connections after a short while.

Two approaches to fix this:

<hr />

## 1/ Comment (not client-aware)

You can emit a comment (any line starting with a colon `:`)

```
< :bump
```

Good enough to keep connection alive.

EventSource won't emit any event.

---

# Implementation Considerations: Proxies (2)

## Proxies can kill

Proxies, load balancers and other networking middleware can kill idle connections after a short while.

Two approaches to fix this:

<hr />

## 2/ Heartbeat event (client-aware)

Emit a custom "heartbeat" or "ping" event every 15 seconds or so:

```
< event: heartbeat
< data: ""
```

(data field **must** be present)

The client can listen to this event and use it to detect stale connections:

**"expect heartbeats every N seconds, otherwise reconnect"**

Preferred approach, especially for important payloads.

---

# Implementation Considerations: Service Workers (Firefox)

## Firefox Service Workers üíî EventSource

Firefox has yet to implement support for EventSource in its Service Worker context.

Future people can track the present validity of this statement [here](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1681218).

‚úÖ But you can use it in a SharedWorker

# Vs Polling

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}

## 1a/ Polling

Keep requesting new data on an interval

- Slower
- Can more resource intensive than SSE

Benefit: Doesn't "hog" a connection (HTTP/1.1)

:::
::: {.column width="33%"}

## 1b/ Long Polling

"Hanging GET" - server keeps connection open/hanging until there is something to write.

Client loops the GET request.

:::
::: {.column width="33%"}

## 2/ SSE

- Like formalized, reusable long polling
- Tradeoff:
  - open sockets vs.
  - data store lookups

:::

# Kadena use case

Blockchain stuff usually comes with lots of polling. E.g. determining finality

Kadena's Chainweb is 20 "braided" chains -> 20x polling threads (worst case)

[Chainweb-stream](https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-stream):

- SSE Server
- Streams transactions of a certain type (specific account or application/contract)

[Chainweb-stream-client](https://github.com/kadena-community/kadena.js/tree/main/packages/libs/chainweb-stream-client):

- Client side lib (node, browser)
- Detects stale connections (heartbeat events)
- Detects initial connection timeouts
- Custom reconnection (exponential backoffs)
